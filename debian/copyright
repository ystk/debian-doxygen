    trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer

         license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
         initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification
         in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain
         available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of
         the initial developer.

         notices in the distribution explaining this.

      a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
         these items are also able to receive and use the complete
         machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
         beyond the costs of data transfer.
 .
      b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
         and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
         both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
         be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
         able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
 .
      c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
         initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
         then you must supply one.
 .
 			    Limitations of Liability
 .
 In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable
 for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost
 revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or
 consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility
 of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides
