Description: Documentation system for C, C++, Java, Python and other languages
 Doxygen is a documentation system for C, C++, Java, Objective-C, Python, IDL
 and to some extent PHP, C#, and D.  It can generate an on-line class browser
 (in HTML) and/or an off-line reference manual (in LaTeX) from a set of
 documented source files. There is also support for generating man pages
 and for converting the generated output into Postscript, hyperlinked PDF
 or compressed HTML.  The documentation is extracted directly from the sources.
 .
 Install the doxygen-latex package to build LaTeX based documents.
